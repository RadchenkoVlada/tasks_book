# Tasks from books "Python for everybody" by Charles R. Severance

There are completed tasks from the book called "Python for everybody" by Charles R. Severance that 
I found and read on the site "coursera" on the "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" 
and "Python data structures" courses.

Assignments were taken from chapters 1-12 inclusive.

Also, there are assignments on sets and dictionaries from web-site 
https://server.179.ru/tasks/python/2014b1/17-sets.html 
in a folder named "internet_tasks" from the internet.

There are also completed tasks from the book "Python Crash course" by Eric Matthes from Chapter 9: Classes in the folder "crash_course".


In addition to the tasks above i have dove exercises from the "Electronic taskbook: Programming Taskbook version 4.5" 
by M. Abramyan. All completed by me tasks are in the folder - "Programming Taskbook"
