There are completed tasks from the book called "Python for everybody" by Charles R. Severance that 
I found and read on the site "coursera" on the "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" 
and "Python data structures" courses.

Assignments were taken from chapters 1-12 inclusive.
***
Also, there are assignments on sets and dictionaries from web-site 
https://server.179.ru/tasks/python/2014b1/17-sets.html 
in a folder named "internet_tasks" from the internet.

There are also completed tasks from the book "Python Crash course" by Eric Matthes from Chapter 9: Classes in the folder "crash_course".

In addition to the tasks above i have dove exercises from the "Electronic taskbook: Programming Taskbook version 4.5" 
by M. Abramyan. All completed by me tasks are in the folder - "Programming Taskbook"

Folder Linked_List contains my implementation of linked lists. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library.
Linked lists are like a lesser-known cousin of lists.

I created such a list and create additional methods to append and remove, get the length
of list. Also magic methods: __str__(), __bool__(), __getitem__() and so on were implemented by me.
I also wrote unit tests using the "unittest" library.
