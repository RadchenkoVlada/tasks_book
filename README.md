# Tasks from book "Python for everybody" by Charles R. Severance

There are completed tasks from the book that I found and read on "coursera"
on the Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) course.

Assignments were taken from chapters 1-10 inclusive.

Also, there are assignments on sets and dictionaries from web-site 
https://server.179.ru/tasks/python/2014b1/17-sets.html 
in a folder called "internet_tasks" from the internet.
