Exercise 3:
 Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000
 characters, and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this
 exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.
